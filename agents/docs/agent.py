"""
Docs - Agno Documentation Agent (via LLMs.txt)
===========================

Answers developer questions about the Agno framework by dynamically
fetching documentation pages via the llms.txt protocol. No pre-loading
required -- the agent reads the index and fetches relevant pages on demand.

Every response is scored by an AgentAsJudgeEval post-hook so demo-os users can
still see eval results accumulated in the DB.
