"""
Workflows
=========

@context's runnable Agno `Workflow` objects — the deterministic background jobs the
scheduler fires (see `app/schedules.py`). Each module owns one concern end to end:
its step executor(s) and the `Workflow` object that wraps them.

- `reminders` — the hourly reminder sweep (`queue_reminders_workflow`). Also home to
  the `queue_reminders` owner *tool* the context agent calls in chat, since both
  share one core (`_queue_reminders`).
- `digest` — the daily rundown / weekly week-plan digests (`daily_digest_workflow`,
  `weekly_digest_workflow`), delivered to the owner's Slack DM.
- `notify` — `dm_owner`, the shared self-notification path both of the above use.

`WORKFLOWS` is the registration list handed to `AgentOS(workflows=...)` in
`app/main.py`. Scheduling (which of these fire, and when) is a separate, cross-
cutting concern that lives in `app/schedules.py`, not here.
