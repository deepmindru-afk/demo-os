# Connecting @context to Gmail and Google Calendar

## Setup (a few minutes, one time)

### 1. Create the Google app

This is a one-time thing in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). We create an app that says "this program may ask for access to my account". The app belongs to you and lives in your Google project. All credentials are stored with you.

1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com and, using the account switcher at the top right, select the Google account you want to connect to @context.
2. In the project dropdown in the top bar, pick a project — or click **New Project** to make one.
3. **Turn on the two APIs.** Go to **APIs & Services → Library**. Search **Gmail API**, open it, click **Enable**. Go back to the Library and do the same for **Google Calendar API**. Each takes a few seconds; nothing else to fill in.
4. **Set up the consent screen and add the scopes.** Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** (newer projects label this **Google Auth Platform**) and work through the prompts — app name, your email for user support, your email for the developer contact. It also asks for a **User type** (Internal vs. External); [section 2 below](#2-increase-login-lifetime) covers which to pick. When you reach the **Scopes** step (called **Data Access** in the newer UI), click **Add or remove scopes**, paste the five lines below into the **Manually add scopes** box, click **Add to table**, then **Update**:
   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
   ```
   You have to paste them — Gmail and Calendar are *sensitive* scopes, so they don't show up in the checklist of suggestions; the manual box is the only way to add them.
5. **Create the credentials.** Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**, choose application type **Desktop app**, and create it. Keep the **client ID** and **client secret** it shows you — they go in `.env` in step 3 below.

### 2. Increase login lifetime

Out of the box, Google puts a new app in **"Testing,"** and in that mode the login it issues **expires after 7 days** — so @context would lose access every week. Flip one setting so it sticks:

- **If your account is Google Workspace** (e.g. a company domain): set the consent screen's **User type** to **Internal**. Internal apps don't expire and need no review. Done.
- **If it's a personal `@gmail.com`:** set the consent screen's **Publishing status** to **In production**. The login stops expiring. Because the Gmail scopes are sensitive, you'll click past an "unverified app" notice the first time you connect — that's expected for your own app and fine; Google's formal verification only matters if you hand the app to lots of other people.

### 3. Add the credentials to `.env`

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=***.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=***
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### 4. Connect your account

The consent screen opens a browser, so this runs on your machine, not in the container. From the repo root, with the venv active (`./scripts/venv_setup.sh` if you don't have one):

```bash
python scripts/google_mint_tokens.py
```

It reads `.env` (and `.env.production`, if you have one) and opens a browser to connect each service you haven't linked yet — Gmail, then Calendar; approve both — writing `gmail_token.json` / `calendar_token.json` at the repo root.

It prints the Google account each token is connected to, so you can confirm it's the right one. The dev container picks the token files up through the existing `.:/app` mount.

Pass `--force` to re-mint from scratch or to connect a different account.

### 5. Restart

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Deploying (Railway)

The tokens are stored in a file on the local filesystem. These files are gitignored and are not part of the image.

But for production, we store the tokens as environment variables that are decoded by the entrypoint at startup.

The `google_mint_tokens.py` script sets this up for you: once the tokens are written it base64s them into `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON_B64` and `CALENDAR_TOKEN_JSON_B64` in `.env.production`, then offers to run `./scripts/railway/env-sync.sh` to push them to Railway. It only writes to `.env.production` — local dev reads the token files directly through the `.:/app` mount, so `.env` never needs them.

## Verify

Ask, as the owner:

```
What's on my calendar today?
Any unread email from Acme this week?
```

Both should answer from `query_calendar` / `query_gmail` and cite what they
found. Then try a write:

```
Draft a follow-up to Sarah at Acme thanking her for today's call.
```

A draft appears in your Gmail for you to send. Ask it to put something on your
calendar and you'll get an approval request in the AgentOS UI first — confirm
and it's booked, decline and nothing happens.

## Letting @context send email

Off by default on purpose — drafting keeps you in control and means nothing goes
out unread. If you do want @context to send directly:

1. In [`agents/sources.py`](../agents/sources.py), in `_create_gmail_provider`,
   stop stripping the send tools (the `_DraftOnlyGmail` subclass) — or use
   `GmailContextProvider` directly.
2. Add `update_gmail` to `ACT_TOOLS` in the same file, so every send **pauses
   for your approval** the same way calendar changes do — never ship sending
   ungated.

Then it'll draft unless you say "send," and a send waits for your okay in the
approvals queue.

## Troubleshooting

- **Neither provider showed up after restart.** A provider only builds when its
  credentials are set; a misconfig is logged and skipped (the app still starts).
  Check the startup logs for a `_create_gmail_provider failed` /
  `_create_calendar_provider failed` warning, and confirm `.env` has
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **Access stopped working after about a week.** The app is still in "Testing" —
  do step 2 (Internal for Workspace, or Publish for personal), then re-run
  `python scripts/google_mint_tokens.py --force` (it re-mints, rewrites the
  base64, and offers the Railway sync).
- **`access_blocked` / "app isn't verified" during connect.** On a personal
  account, add your address as a **test user** on the consent screen, or finish
  publishing it (step 2). Clicking past the unverified notice is expected for
  your own app.
- **A token got revoked.** Re-run the mint script with `--force` — it re-mints,
  rewrites the base64, and offers the Railway sync.

## Scope it down

@context acts with whatever the token allows. Keep the consent to exactly the
five scopes above, for the one account it should touch — nothing else. The
residual-risk notes live in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
