# The MCP channel

`@context` exposes itself as an **MCP server** so you can read, act, and file
through your context straight from your MCP client. The headline: the **Claude
and ChatGPT desktop apps reach it on localhost with zero setup** — no Slack app,
no bot tokens, no tunnel. The client learns what `@context` is and uses it on its
own, so you often don't even have to ask for it by name.

It's **always on** — not a setting you opt into — and **owner-only, fail-closed**:
it runs the agent as *you*, so only you can reach it. Teammates keep their write
path (Slack `submit_update` / the context network — see [`NETWORK.md`](NETWORK.md));
they never touch this endpoint.

## The two tools

Both run the *real* `context` agent ([`app/mcp.py`](../app/mcp.py)) as the owner,
so they get your full read/write surface. They differ only in *when* the client
should reach for them:

| Tool | For | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `ask_context(message, session_id?)` | Reading / acting | "what's waiting on me?", "what do we know about Acme?", "draft a reply to Sarah" |
| `update_context(message, session_id?)` | Filing / updating | "met Sarah from Acme, follow up Friday", "we decided to ship MCP first", "remind me to review the deck tomorrow" |

`session_id` is optional — pass a stable one to continue a thread.

## Use it from a desktop app (local, zero setup)

The desktop apps run on your machine, so they can reach `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
directly. Bring `@context` up locally (`docker compose up -d`) and add a connector:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
- **Auth**: none locally (dev runs without JWT; the channel binds to you as the
  owner — the same keyless-local-as-owner shortcut the rest of dev uses).

Claude Desktop / ChatGPT desktop will list `ask_context` and `update_context`.
That's the whole setup.

> Localhost only works from an app on the **same machine**. A cloud model
> (ChatGPT on the web, Claude on the web) runs on a remote server and cannot
> reach your laptop — for those, deploy or tunnel (below).

## Use it from the cloud (deploy, or ngrok)

Cloud clients need a public HTTPS URL. Two ways, the same two we use for Slack:

**Deploy it (recommended).** Deploy `@context` (see the Railway steps in the
[README](../README.md)) and you get a public domain. The MCP endpoint is
`https://<your-domain>/mcp`. In production `RUNTIME_ENV=prd` turns JWT on, so the
channel is properly owner-gated. Add the connector with:

- **URL**: `https://<your-domain>/mcp`
- **Auth header**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` — the token os.agno.com mints
  for your AgentOS (the same one the REST API uses).

**Tunnel for a quick test (ngrok).** Same trick as local Slack dev:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
# Point AGENTOS_URL at the tunnel domain so the channel accepts that Host
# (DNS-rebinding protection — see below), then use https://<id>.ngrok.app/mcp
```

⚠️ A tunnel to a **dev** instance has no JWT, so the owner gate falls back to
"you" for *anyone who has the URL* — i.e. an open door to your context. Only
tunnel a `RUNTIME_ENV=prd` run (real JWT), put auth on the tunnel, or keep it
ephemeral and shut it down right after.

### ChatGPT specifics

ChatGPT reaches remote MCP servers through **Connectors** and the **Responses
API** — both public-HTTPS only, same as above. The smoothest path for these two
tools is the Responses API `mcp` tool: pass `server_url` + `headers:
{Authorization: "Bearer <JWT>"}`, which works with our static token. The consumer
connector UI leans on OAuth and tier-gates some features, so the API / developer
path is the easier one today.

## How it's secured

- **Owner-only, in code.** In prod the same JWT middleware AgentOS uses validates
  the token, then `OwnerOnlyMiddleware` 401s anyone who isn't in `OWNER_ID` — it
  never falls back to the guest surface. An unauthenticated call, a valid
  non-owner token, and the scheduler sentinel are all rejected. (Details:
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) L7.)
- **DNS-rebinding protection** is on, since an always-on local server is exactly
  what it protects. The Host allowlist is anchored on localhost (so the desktop
  case needs no config) plus the host from `AGENTOS_URL` (so a deploy or tunnel
  works — point `AGENTOS_URL` at that domain). A request with any other Host is
  rejected with 421.
- **Acting.** Reads, drafting email, Slack messages, and filing all run to
  completion. The one approval-gated act tool — `update_calendar` — still pauses
  for approval, and there's no approval affordance over MCP, so the tool returns
  a note telling you to approve it in the AgentOS chat UI and ask it to continue.

## Why not AgentOS's built-in MCP server

AgentOS ships `enable_mcp_server=True`, kept **off** here. It registers ~19 fixed,
unscopeable tools (`run_agent` + full session/memory CRUD), and its `run_agent`
drops identity (no `user_id`) — a call through it would resolve to the
capture-only guest surface, the opposite of what this channel is for. Ours is a
small server that threads the owner identity through and exposes exactly the two
tools above.

## Verifying locally

With the stack up, point a streamable-HTTP MCP client at
`http://localhost:8000/mcp` (mirroring `cookbook/05_agent_os/mcp_demo/test_client.py`
in the Agno repo). `list_tools` returns `["ask_context", "update_context"]`;
`ask_context` with a workspace question comes back citing real files (proof the
owner toolset is threaded through), and `update_context` files what you tell it.
