# Demo AgentOS

A multi-agent system showcasing 45+ agentic features across 10 agents, 11 multi-agent teams, and 4 workflows.

This is a reference implementation for building production agentic software with Agno. Every major Agno capability: RAG, MCP, human-in-the-loop, guardrails, approvals, reasoning, structured output, multi-model, entity memory, scheduling, team modes, and workflows, is demonstrated in a working agent you can run, test, and extend.

This codebase demonstrates two things:

1. **You can run a near-unlimited number of agents in a single service.** 10 agents, 11 teams, and 4 workflows all run in one process. Scale the number of replicas based on load, not the number of agents.
2. **You don't need complex architecture to run agentic software.** There's no event queues, no message bus, no custom infrastructure. It's a FastAPI app with a PostgreSQL database.

Agentic software is just software. Using systems engineering principles, you can build production-grade agent systems with Agno, the same way you'd build any other service.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/demo-os.git demo-os
cd demo-os

cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Start the application
docker compose up -d --build

# Load documents for the knowledge agent
docker exec -it agno-demo-api python -m agents.knowledge.scripts.load_knowledge

# Load SaaS data for Dash
docker exec -it agno-demo-api python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_data
docker exec -it agno-demo-api python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_knowledge
```

Confirm the system is running at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## Deploy to Railway

Requires:
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment

```sh
railway login

./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

The script provisions PostgreSQL, configures environment variables, and deploys the application.

### Connect the Web UI

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
2. Click "Add OS" -> "Live"
3. Enter your Railway domain

### Manage deployment

```sh
railway logs --service agno-demo      # View logs
railway open                         # Open dashboard
railway up --service agno-demo -d    # Update after changes
```

To stop services:
```sh
railway down --service agno-demo
railway down --service pgvector
```

### Load data in production

```sh
# Knowledge agent — Agno documentation
railway run python -m agents.knowledge.scripts.load_knowledge

# Dash — table schemas, validated queries, and business rules
railway run python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_knowledge

# Dash — SaaS data (customers, subscriptions, invoices, usage, support)
railway run python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_data
```

## Common Tasks

<details>
<summary><strong>Add your own agent</strong></summary>

1. Create `agents/my_agent/` with these files:

**`agents/my_agent/agent.py`**
```python
from agno.agent import Agent

from agents.my_agent.instructions import INSTRUCTIONS
from app.settings import MODEL, agent_db

my_agent = Agent(
    id="my-agent",
    name="My Agent",
    model=MODEL,
    db=agent_db,
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    add_datetime_to_context=True,
    add_history_to_context=True,
    read_chat_history=True,
    num_history_runs=5,
    markdown=True,
)
```

**`agents/my_agent/instructions.py`**
```python
INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are a helpful assistant.
"""
```

**`agents/my_agent/__init__.py`**
```python
from agents.my_agent.agent import my_agent as my_agent
```

**`agents/my_agent/__main__.py`**
```python
from agents.my_agent.agent import my_agent

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_agent.cli_app(stream=True)
```

2. Register in `app/main.py`:

```python
from agents.my_agent import my_agent

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[..., my_agent],
    ...
)
```

3. Add quick prompts to `app/config.yaml` using the agent's `id`

4. Restart: `docker compose restart`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Add tools to an agent</strong></summary>

Agno includes 100+ tool integrations. See the [full list](https://docs.agno.com/tools/toolkits).

```python
from agno.tools.slack import SlackTools
from agno.tools.scheduler import SchedulerTools

my_agent = Agent(
    ...
    tools=[
        SlackTools(),
        SchedulerTools(db=agent_db),
    ],
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use a different model provider</strong></summary>

1. Add your API key to `.env` (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
2. Update agents to use the new provider:

```python
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5")
```
3. Add dependency: `anthropic` in `pyproject.toml`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Giving Coda access to GitHub</strong></summary>

Coda can clone and push to GitHub repos when you provide a **Fine-grained Personal Access Token**.

### Create the token

1. Go to **GitHub -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> [Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)**
2. Click **Generate new token**

### Configure it

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Token name** | `coda` (or whatever helps you identify it) |
| **Expiration** | 90 days (set a calendar reminder to rotate) |
| **Repository access** | **Only select repositories** -- pick the repos Coda should work on |

### Set permissions

| Permission | Access | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Contents** | Read and write | Clone, read files, commit, push |
| **Metadata** | Read-only | Required by GitHub for all token operations |

That's it -- two permissions. Add more only if needed (e.g., **Pull requests** read/write for opening PRs).

### Pass it to Coda

Add to your `.env`:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Coda only pushes to `coda/*` branches -- it will never push to main.

### Rotating tokens

When a token expires, generate a new one with the same settings, update `.env`, and restart: `docker compose up -d`.
