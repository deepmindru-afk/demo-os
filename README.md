# @context - professional context manager

@context is a self-hosted context manager. It organizes your work context into a private CRM and knowledge base so you can stay on top of things.

It plugs into clients like claude, chatGPT, claude code, and codex, and gives them a source of @context about your work. I use it with claude code to manage product specs.

Connect @context to slack and gmail, and you get a powerful chief of staff with context about everything, available in your favorite AI tools.

> Your AI tools are users of context, not competitors.

@context is built with privacy and security as first principles. It runs in two modes:

1. **Owner mode.** You get every tool. Capture context (*"met Kyle from Agno, follow up next week"*), retrieve context (*"give me a rundown of my day"*), and prepare context (*"process today"*).
2. **Guest mode.** Teammates (*and their agents*) can leave updates in your queue. You get briefed when you ask for a rundown.

@context runs on Agno's AgentOS runtime, so user identity is verified on every request, and tools are assigned by role (owner or guest).

> Built on [Agno](https://docs.agno.com).

## Scope

@context has five jobs.

1. **Maintain a crm.** Share *"met Kyle from Agno, wants a partnership, follow up next week"* and it stores a contact, a note, and a dated reminder without you picking forms or fields.
2. **Maintain a knowledge base.** @context can write product specs, parse notes from customer interviews, manage project briefs and conduct deep research, and maintain it all in a neatly organized knowledge base.
3. **Run your day, plan your week, prep for what's next.** @context can run playbooks to run your day, plan your week, and prep for meetings. @context comes with a few playbooks but you should definitely customize and add your own. Here are the included ones:
   - **Rundown** *("what's on today?")* - a prioritized brief of things on your plate. One digest instead of five apps: the updates teammates (and their agents) left in your queue, reminders that are due, today's meetings, the emails you missed, and the Slack threads worth a look.
   - **Week plan** *("what's my week?")* - priorities for the week. Runs sunday evening and lands in your DMs, so you start the week with 🔥
   - **Prep** *("prep for my 2pm with Kyle")* - a tight pre-meeting brief: who they are, notes, past threads, what's still open, email and Slack exchanges, and - for not known contacts - public background pulled from the web.

   @context runs these playbooks on demand or on a schedule: the daily rundown and weekly plan will DM the brief straight to you.
4. **Represent you.** Your teammates (and their agents) can share non-urgent updates with your @context. A teammate types *"@your-context my claude fixed the auth bug"* and it's saved to your queue - surfacing in your next rundown. It works outbound too: your @context can message people and channels on Slack on your behalf, and @-mention a teammate's @context to drop an update in *their* queue - which is how a team's contexts talk to each other (the [context network](docs/NETWORK.md)). This keeps your signal-to-noise high.
5. **Draft and schedule.** Connect [Gmail and Calendar](docs/GOOGLE.md) and @context reads your real inbox and calendar, drafts your follow-ups straight into Gmail for you to send, and sends calendar changes to your approvals queue. It only ever *drafts* email — it never sends on its own.

## Security

@context is an alter ego with access to a lot of sensitive information and the security boundaries need to be AIRTIGHT.

Agno's AgentOS makes it possible to:
1. Verify the user making the request. AgentOS extracts the `user_id` from the JWT or Slack request. This allows us to determine if the request is from the owner or a guest.
2. Based on the user's role (owner or guest), we can choose the right tools to add to the agent.

This security model enables us to design a system that permits anyone to write to it but only you can read or act through it. To everyone else it is a polite notetaker that only captures. Although it does remember who it is talking to: each caller gets their own user-memory, kept entirely separate from yours.

To push our security boundary even further, acting in the outside world is gated. Changing your calendar (`update_calendar`) pauses for explicit approval before it runs — AgentOS's `requires_confirmation` / `approval_type="required"` settings. Email goes a step further: `update_gmail` can *only* draft (it never sends), so the follow-up waits in your Gmail drafts for you to review and send.

Finally, everything runs locally or in your own cloud, inside your VPC, with every byte of data (context's database, context's knowledge base, context's inbox) being stored in your own database.

Read [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Get started

> Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/context.git
cd context

# Configure credentials
cp example.env .env
# Open .env: set OPENAI_API_KEY, and set OWNER_ID to the email you sign in to
# os.agno.com with (that is how the UI resolves you as the owner).
# OWNER_NAME is an optional display name, set it as your or your company's name.

# Run on Docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

Confirm it is live at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## MCP server

The main way to use @context is from an MCP client like Claude Code, Codex, Claude, and ChatGPT.

@context comes with an MCP server at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`. I use it with claude code to manage product spects, which another claude code or codex instance can implement. I also use it with desktop apps (Claude, ChatGPT) and web clients (ChatGPT web, Claude web).

> Note: @context's MCP server is **owner-only**, and runs by default.

Add it to **every MCP client on your machine** in one command:

```sh
python scripts/connect.py
```

It finds Claude Code, Codex, and the Claude Desktop app and registers @context with each — running `claude mcp add` / `codex mcp add` for the CLIs and writing an [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) bridge into `claude_desktop_config.json` for the desktop app (existing keys preserved, a timestamped backup made, anything already set up skipped). `--dry-run` to preview, `--remove` to undo.

Rather do it by hand? The CLI clients are one command each:

```sh
claude mcp add -s user --transport http context http://localhost:8000/mcp   # Claude Code (user scope)
codex mcp add --url http://localhost:8000/mcp context                       # Codex
```

**Claude Desktop** needs that bridge in `claude_desktop_config.json` — its "Add custom connector" dialog only accepts `https` URLs. Add this (keep any existing keys) and restart the app:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp", "--transport", "http-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

**ChatGPT and the web clients** (ChatGPT web, Claude web) can't use a local bridge — ChatGPT only reaches MCP servers as a remote HTTPS connector, and the web clients can't see localhost at all. Give them a public HTTPS URL by deploying or tunnelling (`https://<domain>/mcp` + `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`, the same two paths as Slack).

[`docs/MCP.md`](docs/MCP.md) has the by-hand desktop steps, the deployed/HTTPS connector path (incl. the GUI-`PATH` `npx` gotcha and Windows notes), and how it's secured (owner-only, fail-closed, DNS-rebinding protection).

## AgentOS UI

@context runs on AgentOS, which comes with a web UI for interacting with @context. Use the AgentOS UI to chat with @context, view sessions, approve actions and more.

<img width="3066" height="2046" alt="Local Context AgentOS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee4b789a-1612-4b5d-9bd4-37e68ede91c4" />

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and sign in with your email (the same one you set as `OWNER_ID`).
2. Click **Connect AgentOS → Local**.
3. Enter `http://localhost:8000`, name it "Local Context" and connect.
4. Click on the chat button under Context.
5. Try one of the quick prompts.

## Slack

Slack is where @context comes alive. It's the interface where I (@ashpreetbedi) use it the most and the interface that allows your team (and their agents) to talk to @context.

To set it up, you need to:
1. Create a Slack app
2. Get the Bot User OAuth Token and Signing Secret
3. Set the environment variables in `.env` or `.env.production`
4. Restart the application

Read [`docs/SLACK.md`](docs/SLACK.md) for the Slack setup guide.

Notes:
- Agno's AgentOS automatically sets up the Slack interface when the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` env vars are set.
- The `resolve_user_identity=True` flag tells the AgentOS to resolve the Slack user identity to an email, which is what `OWNER_ID` matches against to determine the caller's role (owner or guest).

## @context Knowledge Base

@context comes with a long-term knowledge base that acts as its second brain. @context stores everything from product specs and research notes to "what I know about X" pages in this knowledge base.

The knowledge base is configured as filesystem-backed by default (a gitignored `knowledge/` folder in this repo) but I highly recommend pointing it to a git repo or notion database for production. See [`docs/KNOWLEDGE.md`](docs/KNOWLEDGE.md) for the full guide.

Try:
- *Write a one-pager on the advantages of building our own agent-platform*
- *Write up a decision: we're standardizing on agno*
- *What in my knowledge base needs attention?*

## @context CRM

@context comes with a postgres-backed **CRM** that gives it long-term **structured memory** about people, projects, meetings, reminders, notes and contacts.

This auto-managing crm is @context's superpower. Use it to manage projects, meetings, reminders, notes, and contacts. @context maps what you tell it onto the right table - no forms, no fields - and can create new tables on demand. Try:
- *"Add Dana Reyes, Head of Platform at Acme, dana@acme.com - and remind me to send her the integration spec next Tuesday."*
- *"Who do I know at Acme?"*
- *"What reminders do I have coming up?"*
- *"Tell me about Northwind."*

@context's database lives in the `crm` Postgres schema: writes are confined to that schema and every row is scoped to your `user_id`, so a guest's can't see this data. See [`docs/CRM.md`](docs/CRM.md) for the schema, the filing rules, and the write boundary.

## Run in production

@context runs anywhere that runs a Docker container.

The repo includes script to run on Railway. The `scripts/railway/up.sh` script will run @context as a service with Postgres on the same private network. It reads credentials from `.env.production`, and creates a public domain you connect to in the AgentOS UI.

> Requires the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/cli#installing-the-cli)

### 1. Production env

Create the production environment file.

```sh
cp .env .env.production
```

The deploy scripts read `.env.production` first and falls back to `.env` if it doesn't exist.

### 2. Deploy

Run the `up.sh` script to run @context + postgres on Railway.

First, login to Railway.

```sh
railway login
```

Then run the `up.sh` script.

```sh
./scripts/railway/up.sh
```

The script will now pause and wait for you to mint the JWT verification key.

### 3. Enable Token Based Authorization

Token-Based Authorization is on by default. Without the `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` environment variable in `.env.production`, the AgentOS will not serve traffic. That is the safe default for an agent that has access to sensitive information. You can issue and verify your own JWT (see [BYO JWT](https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/security/authorization/self-hosted)) or mint a JWT verification key at [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com).

The `up.sh` script pauses and waits for you to add the JWT verification key to `.env.production`. Here's how you can get one from os.agno.com:

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com), click **Connect AgentOS → Live**
2. The `up.sh` script will print the AgentOS domain, paste it into the input field.
3. Enable **Token Based Authorization** and click **Connect**.
4. Copy the public key and paste it into `.env.production`.
5. Back in the terminal, press Enter. `up.sh` will read the key and deploy the AgentOS service to Railway.

### 4. Verify

You can verify the deployment on the Railway dashboard or in the terminal by watching the logs:

```sh
railway logs --service agent-os
```

If you add/update any values in `.env.production`, you can sync them to Railway with:

```sh
./scripts/railway/env-sync.sh
```

### 5. Redeploy after code changes

If you make code changes (which you most definitely will), you can redeploy the AgentOS service to Railway with:

```sh
./scripts/railway/redeploy.sh
```

Or enable auto-deploy in the Railway dashboard:

1. Open the Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to the agent-os service
3. Click **Settings**
4. Click **Source** and select the git repo for this project
5. Set the deploy branch to `main` and click **Save (or Deploy)**

### 6. Point Slack at production

If you set Slack up locally, your Slack app's request URLs still point at your ngrok tunnel - i.e. your laptop - so events never reach the deployed instance.

Repoint the `/slack/events` and `/slack/interactions` request URLs to your Railway domain. AgentOS must already be deployed and serving (JWT key in place) so Slack's URL re-verification passes.

See [`docs/SLACK.md`](docs/SLACK.md#moving-from-local-to-production) for full steps.

## Understanding the codebase

@context has three main components. Review them in order.

### The app (`app/`)

@context is a FastAPI application running the AgentOS runtime. [`app/main.py`](app/main.py) is the entrypoint and [`app/settings.py`](app/settings.py) holds shared settings. [`app/identity.py`](app/identity.py) is where identity is validated. It looks dense, but all it does is check whether `user_id` is in the `OWNER_ID` list (comma-separated). [`app/mcp.py`](app/mcp.py) is the owner-only MCP server — one tool (`use_context`) that lets you read, act, and file through @context from the Claude/ChatGPT desktop apps and CLI clients (see [MCP server](#mcp-server)).

### The agents (`agents/`)

The main agent is [`agents/context.py`](agents/context.py). `context_tools()` adds tools to the agent based on the caller's role, and `caller_information()` adds the matching instructions.

The supporting files:

- [`agents/instructions.py`](agents/instructions.py) defines the role-specific instructions.
- [`agents/sources.py`](agents/sources.py) defines the context providers (crm, knowledge, workspace, web, Slack, Gmail, Calendar) and how each registers its `query_` / `update_` tools.
- [`agents/inbox.py`](agents/inbox.py) defines the inbound queue: `submit_update` (anyone), then `rundown` / `acknowledge` (you only).
- [`agents/policy.py`](agents/policy.py) defines the pre-hook and tool-hook that back the owner/guest boundary.
- [`workflows/`](workflows/) defines the runnable `Workflow` objects (the reminder sweep, the digests) and `dm_owner`; [`app/schedules.py`](app/schedules.py) registers their crons. The reminder sweep (`workflows/reminders.py`) files due reminders into the inbound queue, run hourly by the `queue-reminders` schedule.

### The skills (`skills/`)

The repo has **two distinct kinds of skill**. Keep them separate.

- **Runtime skills** ([`skills/`](skills/)) are playbooks the deployed @context agent runs **for its owner**, invoked in natural language ("plan my week") and owner-gated. Add your own as needed.
- **Coding-agent workflows** ([`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/)) are `/slash-command` workflows your *coding agent* (Claude Code, Codex, others) runs while **developing this repo**. They are covered under [Working with coding agents](AGENTS.md#working-with-coding-agents).

Here are the runtime skills that are included in the repo:

- [`skills/week-plan/SKILL.md`](skills/week-plan/SKILL.md).
- [`skills/daily-rundown/SKILL.md`](skills/daily-rundown/SKILL.md).
- [`skills/prep-for/SKILL.md`](skills/prep-for/SKILL.md).
- [`skills/process-today/SKILL.md`](skills/process-today/SKILL.md).
- [`skills/research/SKILL.md`](skills/research/SKILL.md).
- [`skills/knowledge-review/SKILL.md`](skills/knowledge-review/SKILL.md).

## Connect Gmail and Calendar

With your Gmail connected, `query_gmail` / `query_calendar` ground the rundown and meeting prep in your real inbox and calendar. `update_gmail` writes the follow-up **as a draft in your Gmail** — you review, edit, and send it yourself; it never sends on its own. `update_calendar` proposes events and changes, which land in your approvals queue (the approvals page in the AgentOS UI) for you to confirm.

So reading and prep are frictionless, and the one outward step stays yours. [`docs/GOOGLE.md`](docs/GOOGLE.md) is the few-minute setup (and how to keep the tokens from expiring).

## Evals

The eval suite ([`evals/`](evals/)) is the regression net, and it's built around the one claim that matters: *anyone can write, only you can read.* A deterministic gate proves - with no model in the loop - that a guest's resolved toolset is exactly `submit_update`; adversarial guest cases confirm it refuses to read or leak owner data (even under a prompt-injection that tells it to act as you), and owner cases confirm it actually captures, retrieves, and admits what it can't find. Tool-call and trace-level checks are the spine; an LLM judge corroborates.

```sh
python -m evals                # run the suite
python -m evals -v             # stream the full agent run
python -m evals --case <name>  # one case
```

## Environment variables

`compose.yaml` sets the dev defaults (`RUNTIME_ENV=dev`, `AGNO_DEBUG=True`, `WAIT_FOR_DB=True`, a local `OWNER_ID` + `OWNER_NAME`), so local Docker runs hot-reload, skip JWT, and treat you as the owner. Production reads from `.env.production` via `./scripts/railway/env-sync.sh`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes | none | OpenAI key for models and embeddings. |
| `OWNER_ID` | prd | none | Comma-separated identities that count as the owner (JWT `sub` and/or Slack email). First is canonical. Unset means capture-only for everyone. |
| `OWNER_NAME` | no | canonical `OWNER_ID` | Display name rendered into the prompt. Cosmetic, never matched as an identity. |
| `RUNTIME_ENV` | no | `prd` | `dev` enables hot-reload and disables JWT. Compose sets this to `dev` for local. |
| `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` | prd | none | Public key from os.agno.com. Required when `RUNTIME_ENV=prd`. |
| `AGENTOS_URL` | no | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Scheduler base URL. Also anchors the MCP server's Host allowlist — set it to your Railway/ngrok domain so the deployed or tunnelled `/mcp` endpoint accepts that Host (see [`docs/MCP.md`](docs/MCP.md)). |
| `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` | no | auto-generated | Scheduler-to-OS auth token. Set it when running more than one replica behind one URL — see [`docs/SCALING.md`](docs/SCALING.md). |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | no | none | Switches the `web` source from keyless Parallel MCP to the authenticated SDK (higher rate ceiling). |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | no | none | Both enable the Slack interface. The bot token alone activates the `slack` source (`query_slack` + the ungated `update_slack` send tool) and auto-arms the scheduled digests. See [`docs/SLACK.md`](docs/SLACK.md). |
| `DAILY_DIGEST_CRON` / `WEEKLY_DIGEST_CRON` | no | `0 13 * * *` / `0 22 * * 0` | UTC cron for the Slack-delivered daily rundown and weekly plan (only armed when Slack is set). See [`docs/SLACK.md`](docs/SLACK.md). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` | no | none | Connect your Gmail + Calendar; mint tokens with `python scripts/google_mint_tokens.py`. See [`docs/GOOGLE.md`](docs/GOOGLE.md). |
| `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON_B64` / `CALENDAR_TOKEN_JSON_B64` | no | none | Minted Gmail/Calendar tokens as base64, so they survive a deploy. The entrypoint restores them at startup. See [`docs/GOOGLE.md`](docs/GOOGLE.md). |
| `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_URL` / `KNOWLEDGE_GITHUB_TOKEN` | no | none | Set both to back the `knowledge` base with a Git repo instead of local files. Optional knobs: `KNOWLEDGE_BRANCH` (default `main`), `KNOWLEDGE_LOCAL_PATH`. |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASS` / `DB_DATABASE` | no | matches compose | Postgres connection. |
| `DB_DRIVER` | no | `postgresql+psycopg` | SQLAlchemy driver. |
| `AGNO_DEBUG` | no | `False` | If `True`, Agno emits verbose debug logs. Compose sets this for dev. |
| `WAIT_FOR_DB` | no | `False` | If `True`, the entrypoint blocks on the DB before starting. Compose sets this. |
