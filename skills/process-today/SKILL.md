# Process Today

> _**Runtime skill** — a playbook the deployed @context agent runs for its owner, invoked in natural language. Not a coding-agent workflow; those live in [`.agents/skills/`](../../.agents/skills/)._

Turn today's raw activity into filed context. Unlike the read-only playbooks,
this one **writes** — it ends in `update_crm` / `update_knowledge` calls, not
just a summary. It still never acts on the outside world: no mail, no calendar
changes, nothing leaves.

## Procedure

1. **Anchor on now.** "Today" is the start of the local day → now.
2. **Gather the day's raw material:**
   - `rundown` — inbound updates from others. (It marks what it shows as
     briefed; do *not* acknowledge anything — that's the owner's call.)
   - `query_crm` — today's meetings and the reminders that came due today.
   - When connected: `query_calendar` for today's events; `query_slack` for
     today's threads the owner took part in; `query_gmail` for today's
     meaningful exchanges.
3. **Extract what has lasting value.** From that material, pick out:
   - a new person → contact
   - a thing that happened, a decision made in a thread → note
   - a commitment with a date ("I'll send it Friday") → reminder with `due_at`
   - a follow-up that got scheduled → meeting
   - durable prose (a decision on a spec, how something now works) → the
     knowledge base, in the right spec sub-file
   Skip chit-chat, scheduling back-and-forth, and anything already on file.
4. **File it** with `update_crm` / `update_knowledge`, deduping against what
   exists (an existing contact gets updated, not duplicated). Writes are
   additive — never flip reminder or ack status and never delete anything in
   this playbook.
5. **Report the digest.** One line per item filed (what + where), then a short
   "left unfiled" line for material judged not worth keeping, so the owner can
   overrule.

## Edge cases

- **Safe unattended.** Scheduled runs work end to end: this playbook reads and
  files but never sends, so no approval gate fires.
- **A quiet day is a one-line report** ("Nothing worth filing today.") — not an
  invented summary.
- **When unsure whether something is durable, file a note** — cheap to ignore
  later, expensive to lose.
